# Automatic-1-2-3

This program reconstructs the 1-2-3 trend indicator. By time series auto-correlation, we identify the dominant wavelength and based on this, 
we futherly optimize the TimeScale parameter of the trend indicator. This indicator works by automatically locating the local minima.
Then from the pattern of these minima, the trend status will be identified.
